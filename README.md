# ApiSynIQ

**ApiSynIQ** is an open-source framework that lets users interact with your APIs through natural voice or text instead of filling long frontend forms.  
It understands user intent, fills the required JSON bodies, query parameters, and headers automatically, calls the right API endpoints, and interprets the responses—making API interactions fast, simple, and conversational.

Integrate ApiSynIQ into your application to turn complex workflows like booking tickets, updating user data, or searching products into effortless voice or chat commands.
